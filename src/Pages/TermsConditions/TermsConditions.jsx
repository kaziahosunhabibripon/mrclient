                  the customer doesn't like the first design, we will create a
                  second design for the customer. But we will delete the first
                  design while creating the second design. If the customer
                  decides to accept the first design after seeing the second
                  design. Then the customer will not get the first design from
                  us. We won't create the first design a second time. So if the
                  customer likes the first design, it should be accepted
                  immediately.
